            <h2>
                Isaac Newton
            </h2>
            <p>
                In 1667 he returned to Cambridge and became a fellow of the College of the Holy and Undivided
Trinity [2, 3]. In 1669, and at the age of 26, Newton became the Lucasian professor of mathematics.
According to his secretary Humphrey Newton (no relation), his lectures were often poorly attended and
few understood him and that sometimes he read to the walls [4]. Newton occasionally traveled to London
to attend the Royal Society lectures and was named a fellow in 1672. He became its president from 1703
to 1727. Newton was given various levels of support by the Royal Society. His interpretation of the optical
experiments was strongly disputed by Robert Hooke, an employee of the society since 1664, as a result of
which he published his book Opticks only in 1704, after Hooke’s death. He was supported by the society
in his bitter and controversial dispute with the German polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz over who had developed calculus first [Leibniz’s notations are used today
